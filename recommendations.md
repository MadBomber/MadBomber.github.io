_Senior DevOps Engineer at GigatechSenior DevOps Engineer at Gigatech_
*Regina worked with Dewayne but they were at different companies*

> If you were to use an analogy of a software project team being a football team, Dewayne is the coach that comes in halfway through a losing season, analyzes the team's shortfalls, sees what is impeding the team from winning (poor requirements for example), fires up the teammates, gives them the tools they need with full support behind them to turn it into a winning season.
>
> His software development and integration skills are top notch and he is big on test first, test again, test some more. He leads by example and mentoring, not just delegation, and always steps out of the development box to assist in other needs the team may have and keep the project on track.
>
> I highly recommend him for any software development, software lead, or software architect role.
