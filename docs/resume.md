### Summary

I build mission-critical, test-driven applications. I excel in back-end Ruby on Rails (RoR) business processes, API integrations, data modeling, database optimization, and software refactoring. I have a proven track record of stabilizing, improving performance, and enhancing maintainable feature sets. I am proficient in version control systems such as `git` and requirements management tools such as `jira`. I am also an open source contributor to various Ruby libraries including releasing my own gems.

### Education

Baccalaureate degree in Mathematics with additional majors in Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science

Cameron University, Lawton OK

### Recent Professional Experience

#### Consulting Software Engineer | 10/2022 - 07/2023
**Innovas Solutions**, remote

Client was in the mental healthcare industry, publicly traded.  The product was a nation-wide, public-facing website allowing the user to find a mental healthcare provider, schedule an in-office or video-based session and access a patient portal.  My specific assignment was in support of the back end team working with a Ruby on Rails (version 4) API server.

* Improved stability and performance of a mental healthcare client's Ruby on Rails application.
* Optimized the back-end API and reduced latency in critical database queries.
* Implemented automated processes to ensure consistency in commits and pull requests.
* Standardized clinicians' profile pictures using AI-based image analysis/manipulation libraries in the Python programming language.

#### Architect / Technical Manager | 08/2016 – 07/2018
**Research Contract for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)**, remote

The prime contractors for this federal contract were both VetsEZ and CSRA.  I was a direct employee of both companies.  I left CSRA to join VetsEZ when they took over as the prime contractor.  This project involved several Ruby on Rails monolith applications.  During the life of this contract we upgraded the rails library from version 3 to version 4 to version 5.

* Improved software development effectiveness by integrating sub-contractors into the planning and review process.
* Increased cohesion and productivity of software engineering teams through mentoring and training sessions.
* Developed new leadership skills in developers by rotating team leadership responsibilities.
* Recognized for excellence with a "top-tier" performance rating issued by the VA.

Technical lead on Ruby on Rails (version 4) and NodeJS projects in support of new business development and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

My teams created prototypes for the US Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) which were demonstrated as part of contract proposal efforts and demonstrated at national vendor conferences.  The DOL prototype involved the Oracle RDBMS and a complex workflow process for compensation claims.  The NGA prototype involved in the application of AI techniques in the categorization of and subject element identification of imported images with a geographic map interface that allowed search and retrieval of images based upon auto-generated keywords.

#### Technical Manager of Software Development | 03/2013 - 06/2015

#### Sr. Staff System Engineer / Technical Manager | 09/2005 - 09/2011
**Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control**, Grand Prairie TX

I was a direct employee.

**Virtual Reality System Integration Lab (VRSIL)** 2006-2011

I was a hands-on technical software engineering manager of the VRSIL.  In my lab I declared Ruby as our principle prototyping language. VRSIL was an in-house start-up incubator where principle investigator (PI) would come to the lab an idea. We would coordinate with the business development (BD) department and other applied research and development (AR&D) labs to put meat on the bone of the PI's idea.

* The VRSIL was credited with 7-figures of new sole-source business as a result of our classified prototype demonstrations.
    - One prototype was deployed "as is" to a combat theater.

**Medium Extend Air Defense System (MEADS)** 2005-2006

* Restored customer confidence in the classified MEADS federal program as the department cost account manager for the modeling and simulation (M&S) department using earned value management system (EVMS) while also leading the algorithms group and the threat assessment group.
* Learned my lesson.  When given a choice between multiple programs never say "Put me where it hurts the most."  They did.  it hurt.  I fixed it and got rewarded.... but boy did it hurt.
