### Recent Open Source Projects with gen-AI

I am always experimenting, reviewing, enhancing open source projects.  My most recent work involves using generative-AI (gen-AI).  While I have many years of experience in AI techniques in support of classified military projects they mostly cover knowledge-based systems, classification, clustering and recommendation systems.  This large language model (LLM) GPT-based gen-AI is a significant step forward in the field.  Its roots are firmly evident from the prior work on statistical natural language processing (NLP) and translations.

I've create two Ruby gems in this technology domain.  `prompt_manager` and `aia`

- **[prompt_manager](https://github.com/MadBomber/prompt_manager)** - Parameterized Prompt Management.
 is a parameterized prompt management system that I created to management gen-AI prompts as either text files or database entries.


- **[aia](https://github.com/MadBomber/aia)** - the AI Assistant - gen-AI on the command line.  Uses my `prompt_manager` Ruby gem to front-end several popular CLI-based LLM/GPT tools as well as my own internal LLM/GPT client.

I'm also working on integrating LLM/GPT capability in a stock portfolio analysis project which uses stock quantitative/qualitative analysis with price swing forecasting models much like what you see in weather forecasting of hurricane tracks.  The forecaster is using clustering, classification and regressive techniques and sentiment analysis.  Only some of this work is public.
