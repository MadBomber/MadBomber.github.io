#### Personal Projects

I am always experimenting, reviewing, enhancing open source projects.  My most recent work is:

This is a parameterized prompt manager that I created for the `mods` CLI utility.

    - [mods[(https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods)]

I'm also working on integrating GPT-4 capability in a stock portfolio analysis project which uses stock quantitative analysis with price swing forecasting models much like what you see in weather forecasting of hurricane tracks.  The forecaster is using clustering, classification and regressive techniques and sentiment analysis.  Only some of this work is public in my unreleased Ruby gem `sqa`

I've also written a few short articles on using ChatGPT to code.
